                    The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
                    iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed
                    is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the
                    weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's
                    keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down
                    upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would
                    attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My
                    name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

                    Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That
                    show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people
                    who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide
                    if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and
                    become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She
                    starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

                    I'm sorry, did I break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that.
                    Please, continue, you were saying something about best intentions.
                    What's the matter? Oh, you were finished! Well, allow me to retort.
